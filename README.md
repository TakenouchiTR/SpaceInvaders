# SpaceInvaders

Space Invaders was my final project for CS 3201 Program Construction I. It is a Space Invaders "clone" built using UWP and without any exteral libraries.

## Structure

Space Invaders' design is heavily influenced by the Godot game engine. Everything is represented by a node, with complex structures being made of multiple child nodes.
