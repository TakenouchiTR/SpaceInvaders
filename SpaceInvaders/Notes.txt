I am unable to find any major bugs or missing functionality with the program.

There are some minor issues, such as collision not being checked if a node that is not a direct child of the root
    is moved, but it currently has no effect on gameplay with how the game is structured.

If the stars in the background make tracking enemy bullets difficult, pressing the S key will turn them off.

The game is structured as a tree of nodes, with every part of the game (Sprites, collision, timers, etc.) being 
    respresented as a node. Nodes may have children, which allow for complex structures to be created through
    composition. An entity is a Node2D that has a SpriteNode and a CollisionArea as children, rather than being 
    a new type of node that has a sprite and a way to detect collisions as properties or fields.

I have a quick boss fight that I used to test the structure. It's made up of a boss who has three weak points,
    each requiring three shots to destroy. If you are interested, you can run it by setting "level" to 
    "TestBossLevel" on line 56 of MainPage.xaml.cs.

When two CollisionAreas overlap, both check if their CollisionMasks match the other's CollisionLayers. 
    The CollisionLayer is what the CollisionArea is (An enemy would have the Enemy collision layer), while the
    CollisionMasks is what the CollisionArea is looking for (An enemy would be looking for the things with the
    PlayerHitbox flag). If a CollisionArea is overlapping another CollisionArea and is masking its CollisionLayers, 
    then it emits an event for another Node to handle.
